# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Implementation Drift Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3 ✅, 5 ✅, 7 ✅
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system to handle changes in implementation that affect future tasks.
# Details:
Implement drift handling including:
- Add capability to update future tasks based on completed work
- Implement task rewriting based on new context
- Create dependency chain updates when tasks change
- Preserve completed work while updating future tasks
- Add command to analyze and suggest updates to future tasks

# Test Strategy:
Simulate implementation changes and test the system's ability to update future tasks appropriately. Verify that completed tasks remain unchanged while pending tasks are updated correctly.

# Subtasks:
## Subtask ID: 1
## Title: Create Task Update Mechanism Based on Completed Work
## Status: done
## Dependencies: None
## Description: Implement a system that can identify pending tasks affected by recently completed tasks and update them accordingly. This requires analyzing the dependency chain and determining which future tasks need modification based on implementation decisions made in completed tasks. Create a function that takes a completed task ID as input, identifies dependent tasks, and prepares them for potential updates.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Function implemented to identify all pending tasks that depend on a specified completed task
- System can extract relevant implementation details from completed tasks
- Mechanism to flag tasks that need updates based on implementation changes
- Unit tests that verify the correct tasks are identified for updates
- Command-line interface to trigger the update analysis process

## Subtask ID: 2
## Title: Implement AI-Powered Task Rewriting
## Status: done
## Dependencies: None
## Description: Develop functionality to use Claude API to rewrite pending tasks based on new implementation context. This involves creating specialized prompts that include the original task description, the implementation details of completed dependency tasks, and instructions to update the pending task to align with the actual implementation. The system should generate updated task descriptions, details, and test strategies.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Specialized Claude prompt template for task rewriting
- Function to gather relevant context from completed dependency tasks
- Implementation of task rewriting logic that preserves task ID and dependencies
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Mechanism to preview changes before applying them
- Unit tests with mock API responses

## Subtask ID: 3
## Title: Build Dependency Chain Update System
## Status: done
## Dependencies: None
## Description: Create a system to update task dependencies when task implementations change. This includes adding new dependencies that weren't initially identified, removing dependencies that are no longer relevant, and reordering dependencies based on implementation decisions. The system should maintain the integrity of the dependency graph while reflecting the actual implementation requirements.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Function to analyze and update the dependency graph
- Capability to add new dependencies to tasks
- Capability to remove obsolete dependencies
- Validation to prevent circular dependencies
- Preservation of dependency chain integrity
- CLI command to visualize dependency changes
- Unit tests for dependency graph modifications

## Subtask ID: 4
## Title: Implement Completed Work Preservation
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 8.3 ✅
## Description: Develop a mechanism to ensure that updates to future tasks don't affect completed work. This includes creating a versioning system for tasks, tracking task history, and implementing safeguards to prevent modifications to completed tasks. The system should maintain a record of task changes while ensuring that completed work remains stable.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implementation of task versioning to track changes
- Safeguards that prevent modifications to tasks marked as "done"
- System to store and retrieve task history
- Clear visual indicators in the CLI for tasks that have been modified
- Ability to view the original version of a modified task
- Unit tests for completed work preservation

## Subtask ID: 5
## Title: Create Update Analysis and Suggestion Command
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 8.3 ✅
## Description: Implement a CLI command that analyzes the current state of tasks, identifies potential drift between completed and pending tasks, and suggests updates. This command should provide a comprehensive report of potential inconsistencies and offer recommendations for task updates without automatically applying them. It should include options to apply all suggested changes, select specific changes to apply, or ignore suggestions.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- New CLI command "analyze-drift" implemented
- Comprehensive analysis of potential implementation drift
- Detailed report of suggested task updates
- Interactive mode to select which suggestions to apply
- Batch mode to apply all suggested changes
- Option to export suggestions to a file for review
- Documentation of the command usage and options
- Integration tests that verify the end-to-end workflow

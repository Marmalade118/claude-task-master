# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Command Line Interface Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: âœ… 1 (done)
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic CLI structure using Commander.js with command parsing and help documentation.
# Details:
Implement the CLI foundation including:
- Set up Commander.js for command parsing
- Create help documentation for all commands
- Implement colorized console output for better readability
- Add logging system with configurable levels
- Handle global options (--help, --version, --file, --quiet, --debug, --json)

# Test Strategy:
Test each command with various parameters to ensure proper parsing. Verify help documentation is comprehensive and accurate. Test logging at different verbosity levels.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Commander.js Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure Commander.js as the command-line parsing framework. Create the main CLI entry point file that will serve as the application's command-line interface. Set up the basic command structure with program name, version, and description from package.json. Implement the core program flow including command registration pattern and error handling.

## 2. Implement Global Options Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 1 (done)
### Description: Add support for all required global options including --help, --version, --file, --quiet, --debug, and --json. Implement the logic to process these options and modify program behavior accordingly. Create a configuration object that stores these settings and can be accessed by all commands. Ensure options can be combined and have appropriate precedence rules.
### Details:


## 3. Create Command Help Documentation System [done]
### Dependencies: 1 (done), 2 (done)
### Description: Develop a comprehensive help documentation system that provides clear usage instructions for all commands and options. Implement both command-specific help and general program help. Ensure help text is well-formatted, consistent, and includes examples. Create a centralized system for managing help text to ensure consistency across the application.
### Details:


## 4. Implement Colorized Console Output [done]
### Dependencies: 1 (done)
### Description: Create a utility module for colorized console output to improve readability and user experience. Implement different color schemes for various message types (info, warning, error, success). Add support for text styling (bold, underline, etc.) and ensure colors are used consistently throughout the application. Make sure colors can be disabled in environments that don't support them.
### Details:


## 5. Develop Configurable Logging System [done]
### Dependencies: 1 (done), 2 (done), 4 (done)
### Description: Create a logging system with configurable verbosity levels that integrates with the CLI. Implement different logging levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace) and ensure log output respects the verbosity settings specified by global options. Add support for log output redirection to files. Ensure logs include appropriate timestamps and context information.

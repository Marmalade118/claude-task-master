# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2 ✅, 16 ✅
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a flexible logging system with configurable levels and output formats.
# Details:
Implement logging system including:
- Multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Configurable output destinations
- Command execution logging
- API interaction logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Log file rotation

# Test Strategy:
Test logging at different verbosity levels. Verify that logs contain appropriate information for debugging. Test log file rotation with large volumes of logs.

# Subtasks:
## Subtask ID: 1
## Title: Implement Core Logging Framework with Log Levels
## Status: done
## Dependencies: None
## Description: Create a modular logging framework that supports multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error). Implement a Logger class that handles message formatting, timestamp addition, and log level filtering. The framework should allow for global log level configuration through the configuration system and provide a clean API for logging messages at different levels.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Logger class with methods for each log level (debug, info, warn, error)
- Log level filtering based on configuration settings
- Consistent log message format including timestamp, level, and context
- Unit tests for each log level and filtering functionality
- Documentation for logger usage in different parts of the application

## Subtask ID: 2
## Title: Implement Configurable Output Destinations
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 17.1 ✅
## Description: Extend the logging framework to support multiple output destinations simultaneously. Implement adapters for console output, file output, and potentially other destinations (like remote logging services). Create a configuration system that allows specifying which log levels go to which destinations. Ensure thread-safe writing to prevent log corruption.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Abstract destination interface that can be implemented by different output types
- Console output adapter with color-coding based on log level
- File output adapter with proper file handling and path configuration
- Configuration options to route specific log levels to specific destinations
- Ability to add custom output destinations through the adapter pattern
- Tests verifying logs are correctly routed to configured destinations

## Subtask ID: 3
## Title: Implement Command and API Interaction Logging
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 17.1 ✅, 17.2 ✅
## Description: Create specialized logging functionality for command execution and API interactions. For commands, log the command name, arguments, options, and execution status. For API interactions, log request details (URL, method, headers), response status, and timing information. Implement sanitization to prevent logging sensitive data like API keys or passwords.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Command logger that captures command execution details
- API logger that records request/response details with timing information
- Data sanitization to mask sensitive information in logs
- Configuration options to control verbosity of command and API logs
- Integration with existing command execution flow
- Tests verifying proper logging of commands and API calls

## Subtask ID: 4
## Title: Implement Error Tracking and Performance Metrics
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 17.1 ✅
## Description: Enhance the logging system to provide detailed error tracking and performance metrics. For errors, capture stack traces, error codes, and contextual information. For performance metrics, implement timing utilities to measure execution duration of key operations. Create a consistent format for these specialized log types to enable easier analysis.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Error logging with full stack trace capture and error context
- Performance timer utility for measuring operation duration
- Standard format for error and performance log entries
- Ability to track related errors through correlation IDs
- Configuration options for performance logging thresholds
- Unit tests for error tracking and performance measurement

## Subtask ID: 5
## Title: Implement Log File Rotation and Management
## Status: done
## Dependencies: 17.2 ✅
## Description: Create a log file management system that handles rotation based on file size or time intervals. Implement compression of rotated logs, automatic cleanup of old logs, and configurable retention policies. Ensure that log rotation happens without disrupting the application and that no log messages are lost during rotation.
## Acceptance Criteria:
- Log rotation based on configurable file size or time interval
- Compressed archive creation for rotated logs
- Configurable retention policy for log archives
- Zero message loss during rotation operations
- Proper file locking to prevent corruption during rotation
- Configuration options for rotation settings
- Tests verifying rotation functionality with large log volumes
- Documentation for log file location and naming conventions

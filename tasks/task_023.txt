# Task ID: 23
# Title: Complete MCP Server Implementation for Task Master using FastMCP
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize the MCP server functionality for Task Master by leveraging FastMCP's capabilities, transitioning from CLI-based execution to direct function imports, and optimizing performance, authentication, and context management. Ensure the server integrates seamlessly with Cursor via `mcp.json` and supports proper tool registration, efficient context handling, and transport type handling (focusing on stdio). Additionally, ensure the server can be instantiated properly when installed via `npx` or `npm i -g`. Evaluate and address gaps in the current implementation, including function imports, context management, caching, tool registration, and adherence to FastMCP best practices.
# Details:
This task involves completing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Task Master using FastMCP. Key updates include:

1. Transition from CLI-based execution (currently using `child_process.spawnSync`) to direct Task Master function imports for improved performance and reliability.
2. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed contexts to enhance performance, leveraging FastMCP's efficient transport mechanisms (e.g., stdio).
3. Refactor context management to align with best practices for handling large context windows, metadata, and tagging.
4. Refactor tool registration in `tools/index.js` to include clear descriptions and parameter definitions, leveraging FastMCP's decorator-based patterns for better integration.
5. Enhance transport type handling to ensure proper stdio communication and compatibility with FastMCP.
6. Ensure the MCP server can be instantiated and run correctly when installed globally via `npx` or `npm i -g`.
7. Integrate the ModelContextProtocol SDK directly to streamline resource and tool registration, ensuring compatibility with FastMCP's transport mechanisms.
8. Identify and address missing components or functionalities to meet FastMCP best practices, such as robust error handling, monitoring endpoints, and concurrency support.
9. Update documentation to include examples of using the MCP server with FastMCP, detailed setup instructions, and client integration guides.

The implementation must ensure compatibility with existing MCP clients and follow RESTful API design principles, while supporting concurrent requests and maintaining robust error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the updated MCP server functionality should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Validate direct function imports for Task Master tools, replacing CLI-based execution.
   - Test updated authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Verify context management operations (CRUD, metadata, windowing).
   - Test caching mechanisms for frequently accessed contexts.
   - Validate proper tool registration with descriptions and parameters.

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the MCP server with FastMCP's stdio transport mode.
   - Verify end-to-end request/response cycles for each endpoint.
   - Ensure compatibility with the ModelContextProtocol SDK.
   - Test the tool registration process in `tools/index.js` for correctness and efficiency.

3. Performance tests:
   - Benchmark response times for context operations with large datasets.
   - Test caching mechanisms and concurrent request handling.
   - Measure memory usage and server stability under load.

4. Security tests:
   - Validate the robustness of authentication/authorization mechanisms.
   - Test for vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, CSRF, and unauthorized access.

5. Deployment tests:
   - Verify proper server instantiation and operation when installed via `npx` or `npm i -g`.
   - Test configuration loading from `mcp.json`.

6. Documentation validation:
   - Ensure all examples in the documentation are accurate and functional.
   - Verify manual testing workflows using tools like curl or Postman.

All tests should be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent quality.

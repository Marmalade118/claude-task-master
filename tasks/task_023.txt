# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement MCP Server Functionality for Task Master using FastMCP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend Task Master to function as an MCP server by leveraging FastMCP's JavaScript/TypeScript implementation for efficient context management services.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the Model Context Protocol server capabilities within Task Master using FastMCP. The implementation should:

1. Use FastMCP to create the MCP server module (`mcp-server.ts` or equivalent)
2. Implement the required MCP endpoints using FastMCP:
   - `/context` - For retrieving and updating context
   - `/models` - For listing available models
   - `/execute` - For executing operations with context
3. Utilize FastMCP's built-in features for context management, including:
   - Efficient context storage and retrieval
   - Context windowing and truncation
   - Metadata and tagging support
4. Add authentication and authorization mechanisms using FastMCP capabilities
5. Implement error handling and response formatting as per MCP specifications
6. Configure Task Master to enable/disable MCP server functionality via FastMCP settings
7. Add documentation on using Task Master as an MCP server with FastMCP
8. Ensure compatibility with existing MCP clients by adhering to FastMCP's compliance features
9. Optimize performance using FastMCP tools, especially for context retrieval operations
10. Add logging for MCP server operations using FastMCP's logging utilities

The implementation should follow RESTful API design principles and leverage FastMCP's concurrency handling for multiple client requests. Consider using TypeScript for better type safety and integration with FastMCP[1][2].

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the MCP server functionality should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each MCP endpoint handler function independently using FastMCP
   - Verify context storage and retrieval mechanisms provided by FastMCP
   - Test authentication and authorization logic
   - Validate error handling for various failure scenarios

2. Integration tests:
   - Set up a test MCP server instance using FastMCP
   - Test complete request/response cycles for each endpoint
   - Verify context persistence across multiple requests
   - Test with various payload sizes and content types

3. Compatibility tests:
   - Test with existing MCP client libraries
   - Verify compliance with the MCP specification
   - Ensure backward compatibility with any MCP versions supported by FastMCP

4. Performance tests:
   - Measure response times for context operations with various context sizes
   - Test concurrent request handling using FastMCP's concurrency tools
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits during extended operation

5. Security tests:
   - Verify authentication mechanisms cannot be bypassed
   - Test for common API vulnerabilities (injection, CSRF, etc.)

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Documentation should include examples of how to test the MCP server functionality manually using tools like curl or Postman.

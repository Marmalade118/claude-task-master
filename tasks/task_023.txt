# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Functionality for Task Master
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: ⏱️ 22 (pending)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend Task Master to function as an MCP server, allowing it to provide context management services to other applications following the Model Context Protocol specification.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the Model Context Protocol server capabilities within Task Master. The implementation should:

1. Create a new module `mcp-server.js` that implements the core MCP server functionality
2. Implement the required MCP endpoints:
   - `/context` - For retrieving and updating context
   - `/models` - For listing available models
   - `/execute` - For executing operations with context
3. Develop a context management system that can:
   - Store and retrieve context data efficiently
   - Handle context windowing and truncation when limits are reached
   - Support context metadata and tagging
4. Add authentication and authorization mechanisms for MCP clients
5. Implement proper error handling and response formatting according to MCP specifications
6. Create configuration options in Task Master to enable/disable the MCP server functionality
7. Add documentation for how to use Task Master as an MCP server
8. Ensure the implementation is compatible with existing MCP clients
9. Optimize for performance, especially for context retrieval operations
10. Add logging for MCP server operations

The implementation should follow RESTful API design principles and should be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the MCP server functionality should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each MCP endpoint handler function independently
   - Verify context storage and retrieval mechanisms
   - Test authentication and authorization logic
   - Validate error handling for various failure scenarios

2. Integration tests:
   - Set up a test MCP server instance
   - Test complete request/response cycles for each endpoint
   - Verify context persistence across multiple requests
   - Test with various payload sizes and content types

3. Compatibility tests:
   - Test with existing MCP client libraries
   - Verify compliance with the MCP specification
   - Ensure backward compatibility with any MCP versions supported

4. Performance tests:
   - Measure response times for context operations with various context sizes
   - Test concurrent request handling
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits during extended operation

5. Security tests:
   - Verify authentication mechanisms cannot be bypassed
   - Test for common API vulnerabilities (injection, CSRF, etc.)

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Documentation should include examples of how to test the MCP server functionality manually using tools like curl or Postman.

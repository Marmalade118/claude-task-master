# Task ID: 23
# Title: Complete MCP Server Implementation for Task Master using FastMCP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize the MCP server functionality for Task Master by leveraging FastMCP's capabilities, transitioning from CLI-based execution to direct function imports, and optimizing performance, authentication, and context management.
# Details:
This task involves completing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Task Master using FastMCP. Key updates include:

1. Transition from CLI-based execution to direct Task Master function imports for improved performance and reliability.
2. Enhance authentication and authorization mechanisms using FastMCP's built-in capabilities (e.g., API keys, OAuth, or JWT).
3. Refactor context management to align with best practices for handling large context windows, metadata, and tagging.
4. Optimize server performance by leveraging FastMCP's efficient transport mechanisms (e.g., stdio or SSE) and implementing caching for frequently accessed contexts.
5. Integrate the ModelContextProtocol SDK directly to streamline resource and tool registration.
6. Update documentation to include examples of using the MCP server with FastMCP, detailed setup instructions, and client integration guides.

The implementation must ensure compatibility with existing MCP clients and follow RESTful API design principles, while supporting concurrent requests and maintaining robust error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the updated MCP server functionality should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Validate direct function imports for Task Master tools.
   - Test updated authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Verify context management operations (CRUD, metadata, windowing).

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the MCP server with FastMCP's stdio and SSE transport modes.
   - Verify end-to-end request/response cycles for each endpoint.
   - Ensure compatibility with the ModelContextProtocol SDK.

3. Performance tests:
   - Benchmark response times for context operations with large datasets.
   - Test caching mechanisms and concurrent request handling.
   - Measure memory usage and server stability under load.

4. Security tests:
   - Validate the robustness of authentication/authorization mechanisms.
   - Test for vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, CSRF, and unauthorized access.

5. Documentation validation:
   - Ensure all examples in the documentation are accurate and functional.
   - Verify manual testing workflows using tools like curl or Postman.

All tests should be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent quality.

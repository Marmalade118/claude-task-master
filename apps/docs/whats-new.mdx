## Latest Features (January 2025)

### ðŸš€ New `task-master start` Command

**Automated Task Execution with Claude Code Integration**

The new `start` command revolutionizes your development workflow by automatically launching Claude Code with comprehensive task context:

```bash
# Start a specific task
task-master start 1.2

# Start the next available task automatically
task-master start

# Preview what would be executed without launching Claude Code
task-master start 1.2 --dry-run
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Task Discovery** - When no ID is provided, finds the next available task based on dependencies and status
- **Rich Context Injection** - Provides Claude Code with task details, requirements, subtasks, and project context

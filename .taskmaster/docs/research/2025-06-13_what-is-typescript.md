## Initial Query

**Question:** What is TypeScript?

**Response:**

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static typing and type annotations. It is a syntactic superset of JavaScript, meaning all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript, but TypeScript adds extra syntax to specify types, enabling compile-time type checking and better tooling support. This helps catch errors early before running the code and improves code quality, especially in large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to plain JavaScript, which can run anywhere JavaScript runs, such as browsers, Node.js, or Deno. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 license[1][2][3][4][5].

## Follow-up 1

**Question:** And why is the sky blue?

**Response:**

- The sky appears blue because sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere, and the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by air moleculesâ€”a process called Rayleigh scattering[1][2][3][5].
- Blue light is scattered more than red light because it has a shorter wavelength, making the sky look blue to our eyes during the day[2][3][5].
- If Earth's atmosphere didn't scatter sunlight, the sky would appear dark, as it does on the Moon, which lacks an atmosphere[5].

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the 'scope-up' and 'scope-down' CLI commands into detailed subtasks, focusing on: 1) Command structure and argument parsing, 2) Task/subtask retrieval and context gathering, 3) AI prompt construction for different strength levels, 4) Response processing and task updating, 5) Error handling and user feedback, and 6) Integration with existing systems including MCP tool. For each subtask, include specific implementation details, dependencies, and test strategies.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity (8/10) due to several factors: 1) It requires integration with multiple existing systems (CLI, AI services, task management), 2) It involves sophisticated AI prompt engineering with context awareness, 3) It needs to handle various parameters and edge cases, 4) It must maintain data integrity across task modifications, and 5) It requires both CLI and MCP tool implementations. The task already has 5 subtasks that cover the main components, but could benefit from one additional subtask focused on testing and documentation."

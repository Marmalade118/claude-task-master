# Title: Implement Fun Easter Egg Commands for Developer Delight
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add playful easter egg commands to the CLI that provide entertainment and stress relief for developers while maintaining the professional nature of the tool.

## Core Problem Statement

Developers often work long hours and need moments of levity to maintain productivity and morale. Adding fun, non-intrusive easter egg commands can:

1. **Boost Developer Morale**: Provide moments of humor and surprise during intense work sessions
2. **Showcase Tool Personality**: Give Task Master a friendly, approachable character
3. **Create Community Engagement**: Fun features often become talking points and increase tool adoption
4. **Stress Relief**: Offer quick mental breaks without leaving the development environment

## Implementation Approach

1. **Add Easter Egg Commands**: Implement hidden/fun commands in commands.js:
   - `fortune` - Display random programming wisdom or motivational quotes
   - `joke` - Show developer-friendly programming jokes
   - `zen` - Display programming zen principles (like Python's zen)
   - `coffee` - ASCII art coffee cup with brewing animation
   - `rubber-duck` - Rubber duck debugging assistant with encouraging messages
   - `praise` - Random praise messages for completed tasks

2. **Command Structure**: Follow existing CLI patterns but make commands discoverable through:
   - Hidden help section (accessible via `--fun` flag on help command)
   - Occasional hints when users complete milestones or long work sessions

3. **Content Management**: Create a separate `easter-eggs.js` module containing:
   - Arrays of quotes, jokes, zen principles
   - ASCII art templates
   - Motivational messages
   - Randomization logic for content selection

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Add subtle hints after task completions ("Try 'task coffee' for a break!")
   - Include fun stats in status displays (e.g., "You've completed X tasks - that deserves a joke!")
   - Optional daily/weekly fun fact notifications

5. **Configuration**: Add optional config settings:
   - `enableEasterEggs` (default: true)
   - `funNotificationFrequency` (never, rare, occasional, frequent)
   - `favoriteEasterEgg` for personalized defaults

6. **ASCII Art and Animations**: Implement simple text-based animations:
   - Coffee brewing progress bars
   - Rubber duck "thinking" animations
   - Celebration ASCII art for major milestones

# Test Strategy:
- Test each easter egg command individually to ensure proper content display and formatting
- Verify ASCII art renders correctly across different terminal sizes and configurations
- Test configuration options to ensure easter eggs can be disabled/customized
- Validate that fun commands don't interfere with core Task Master functionality
- Test hint integration points to ensure they appear at appropriate times without being intrusive
- Verify content randomization works properly and doesn't repeat too frequently
- Test command discovery through hidden help sections
- Ensure all content is appropriate and maintains professional standards while being entertaining
- Test performance impact to ensure easter eggs don't slow down core operations
- Validate that easter egg commands gracefully handle edge cases (empty content arrays, display errors)
